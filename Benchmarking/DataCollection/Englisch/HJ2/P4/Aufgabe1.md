James Baldwin’s quote says we have to face things. In the story, the narrator meets Laylor 
and feels sorry for her. She wants to help but is scared. Laylor is poor but nice. 
The quote fits the story because it’s about problems. If you don’t look at them, they stay. The 
narrator looks but then leaves, so nothing changes.
