In Loose Change, Laylor has a hard life but she is strong. She faces problems like having no 
home or family. The narrator meets her and sees this, but is unsure how to react. 
The quote by Baldwin says that problems need to be faced to be changed. Laylor is an 
example of that. The narrator doesn’t really change anything—she thinks about helping but 
doesn’t do it. 
This shows that it’s not enough to just see problems. You need to act, or nothing happens.
