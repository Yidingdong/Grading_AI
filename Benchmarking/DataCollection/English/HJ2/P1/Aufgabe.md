James Baldwin’s quote perfectly encapsulates the internal conflict of the narrator in Loose 
Change. She begins the story entrenched in aloofness, avoiding connection at all costs, but 
is eventually confronted with a human crisis she can’t ignore. Though she initially faces 
Laylor’s vulnerability—poverty, displacement, loss—she ultimately fails to embrace 
meaningful change by walking away at the end. 
The quote is particularly relevant to Laylor: she has faced unchangeable trauma—her 
parents’ arrest, her exile—but instead of giving up, she bravely engages with others to 
survive. Facing her reality is her only option. 
Thus, Baldwin’s message applies differently to each character: for Laylor, facing hardship 
brings resilience and adaptation; for the narrator, facing suffering sparks empathy, but not 
action. The story shows that facing alone isn't enough without the willingness to act, 
emphasizing the quote’s full depth.
