The quote by Baldwin applies clearly to Loose Change. Laylor is someone who has had to 
face great challenges, like losing her parents and becoming homeless. She doesn’t hide 
from her situation - she asks for help, talks to strangers, and tries to stay hopeful. 
The narrator also faces something: she’s forced to confront her own indifference. In the end, 
though, she chooses not to change. She considers helping Laylor but walks away, meaning 
she faced the situation but didn’t act. 
So Baldwin’s quote fits: not everything can be fixed, but ignoring it means nothing changes. 
Laylor shows courage by facing life directly. The narrator starts to change, but not fully.
