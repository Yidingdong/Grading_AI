The quote means that we canâ€™t change anything unless we first look at it and deal with it. 
Some things might stay the same even if we try, but we still have to face them. This can 
apply to personal problems or things like discrimination. Baldwin shows that change starts 
with awareness, and without it, nothing will improve.
